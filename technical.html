    <h1>Technical overview</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="/">EveryPolitician</a> makes data about politicians
      available in a consistent manner. If you’re a developer who wants
      to write code that consumes that data, this page is for you.
    </p>
    <h2>The data: CSV or JSON (Popolo)</h2>
    <p>
      EveryPolitician publishes the data so you can use it however you want.
      Use it to power your tools, to drive data-based projects, and to help
      people know more about who their politicians are. It’s available to
      download in either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> or
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Broadly speaking, we provide the complete, rich data in JSON. We use the <a
      href="http://www.popoloproject.com/">Popolo standard</a> &mdash; if
      you’re a developer that’s great for you because you get every
      detail of the data. The CSV data is simpler &mdash; it’s ideal for
      dropping into a spreadsheet or displaying in a web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if someone changes their name, their latest name will be
      what’s presented as their name in the CSV. But if you dive into the JSON
      data you’re be able to see the dates when this new name applied, and what
      it was before. You can think of the JSON as the full data in its raw
      form, and the CSVs as the refined, more pragmatic version.
    </p>
    <p>
      EveryPolitician doesn’t provide an API for you to query the data
      &mdash; we simply make the whole lot available for download, and if you
      need to be selective about which bits to use, you can do that
      processing at your end. 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we <em>do</em> slice the CSV data up into separate files
      for each legislative period for a country.  We use these
      "parliamentary terms" because pretty much every legislature in the
      world can be broken down in this way, and applications often only
      really want to know data about the people currently in these
      positions. For many countries we currently only <em>have</em> data
      for the current period, but we‘re very keen to also add older,
      "historic" data too.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Getting the most recent data
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you just browse the site, you’ll find that EveryPolitician links to
      the most recently updated version of its data files.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you’re accessing the data programmatically, that won’t work nicely
      for you because the data is hosted on github, which doesn’t serve the
      right MIME type when your application fetches the data. Instead, you
      should pull it via RawGit, and to do that you’ll need to know the URL of
      the most recent data &mdash; and that means determining the SHA of the git
      commit that put it there. The SHA may be different for each legislature
      (because we rebuild the data as changes and additions come in on a
      per-legislature basis), so to find that out, you need to look in
      <code>countries.json</code>.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Explaining <code>countries.json</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      EveryPolitician publishes a list in JSON format of
      all the countries we have data for:
      <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/everypolitician/everypolitician-data/master/countries.json"><code>countries.json</code></a>.
      This file includes metadata about what’s available to download.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key fields that <code>countries.json</code> has for each country include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>name</code>:
        the name of the country to help human-reading of the data
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>slug</code>:
        the name with spaces replaced by hyphens and punctuation
        stripped, so suitable for use in URLs and directory names
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>code</code>:
        the country code (for example, <code>EE</code> for Estonia),
        which helps with programmatic lookups. We’re using 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2</a>
        country codes where possible (with additional ISO 3166-2 
        three-letter codes where appropriate: for example, <code>GB-WLS</code> for Wales).
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>legislatures</code>:
        a list of legislatures within this county.  There are lots of
        ways governments are organised. Some have a single house, others
        have separate upper and lower chambers. Sometimes a country
        changes its entire legislative process completely, such as the
        Council of Deputies in Libya replaced the General National
        Congress. We separate each of these out individually.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Within the legislatures, in addition to a similar <code>name</code>
      and <code>slug</code>, these fields help you identify and locate the
      data you want:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>popolo</code>:
        the path to the Popolo JSON file
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>lastmod</code>:
        Unix time when the data was last modified
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>sha</code>:
        git’s hash for the commit in which the data was last modified (see following section)
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>legislative_periods</code>:
        a list of each of the terms, or periods. Each one of those has these fields:
        <ul>
          <li><code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>start_date</code>, and <code>slug</code></li>
          <li>
            and also a path (from the directory containing <code>countries.json</code>) to the CSV file containing the data for this term of this legislature
            (for example, <code>data/Bangladesh/House/term-10.csv</code>)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      How to get the most up-to-date version of the data
    </h3>
    <p>
      EveryPolitician’s data is being updated frequently. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The EveryPolitician website offers up the most recent versions of its
      files, so <strong>if you’re just browsing, then you’ll be getting the latest
      data</strong>. But if you’re working with the data programmatically (for example,
      in a client-side app making calls to the data), that won’t work for you.
      GitHub won’t send the right headers, because it’s not really a data
      store. So instead, use the RawGit URL and the most recent SHA, shown as
      <code>sha</code> in the <code>countries.json</code> file, for the data
      for the legislature you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re writing an app and you want to cache the data files locally,
      it’s probably better to do that based on the SHA, and refresh on change.
